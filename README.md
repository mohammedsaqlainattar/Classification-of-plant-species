# ðŸ“œ Classification of plant species :leaves:

:large_blue_diamond: **Project** : Maple Leaves Ltd is a start-up company which makes herbs from different types of plants and its leaves. Currently the system they use to classify the plants which they import in a batch is quite manual. A labourer from his experience decides the leaf type and subtype of plant family. They have asked us to automate this process and remove any manual intervention from this process.

:bulb: **Objective**: To classify the plant leaves by various classifiers from different features of the leaves and to choose the best classifier for future reference.
